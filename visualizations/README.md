## Overview

### Test Day Performance Summary

| Configuration | Lap Time | vs Qualifying | Components |
|--------------|----------|---------------|------------|
| Config 4 | **19.101s** | **0.424s faster** | V2 Flywheel + V2 Carb + V2 Thick Wall Exhaust |
| Config 3 | 19.236s | 0.289s faster | V2 Flywheel + V1 Carb + V2 Thick Wall Exhaust |
| Config 5 | 19.280s | 0.245s faster | V1 Stock Flywheel + V2 Carb + V2 Thick Wall Exhaust |
| Config 1 | 19.298s | 0.227s faster | V2 Flywheel + V1 Carb + V1 Stock Exhaust |
| Config 2 | 19.403s | 0.122s faster | V2 Flywheel + V1 Carb + V1 Stock Exhaust |
| Config 6 | 19.673s | 0.148s slower | V1 Stock Flywheel + V2 Carb + V1 Stock Exhaust |

**Baseline**: Race 23 Q2 Lap 5 - 19.525s

## Visualization Types

### 1. RPM Maps (`rpm_maps/`)

Individual configuration analysis showing:
- GPS-based track layout
- RPM gradient from blue (low) to red (high)
- Performance statistics (speed, G-forces, lap time)
- Component configuration details

**Use for**: Understanding individual configuration characteristics

### 2. RPM Overlays (`rpm_overlays/`)

Direct comparisons showing:
- Qualifying lap (red gradient) vs Configuration lap (blue gradient)
- Both racing lines overlaid on same track
- RPM patterns for both laps
- Time difference analysis

**Use for**: Comparing racing lines and RPM patterns between qualifying and test

### 3. RPM Differentials (`rpm_differentials/`)

Performance advantage visualization showing:
- Green = Configuration has higher RPM (better)
- Yellow = Equal RPM (neutral)
- Red = Qualifying has higher RPM (worse)
- Statistics on max advantages/disadvantages

**Use for**: Identifying exactly where each setup gains or loses power

## Key Findings

### Best Configuration: Config 4
- **Components**: V2 Flywheel + V2 Carb + V2 Thick Wall Exhaust
- **Lap Time**: 19.101s (0.424s improvement over qualifying)
- **Key Advantage**: Combined benefits of all upgraded components

### Component Impact Analysis
Based on configuration comparisons:

1. **V2 Thick Wall Exhaust**: Significant improvement (Config 3 vs Config 1)
2. **V2 Flywheel**: Critical for performance (Config 5 vs Config 4)
3. **V2 Carburetor**: Moderate improvement (Config 4 vs Config 3)

### Worst Configuration: Config 6
- **Components**: V1 Stock Flywheel + V2 Carb + V1 Stock Exhaust
- **Issue**: Stock flywheel + stock exhaust combination underperforms

## Technical Details

### Processing
- 7-point moving average smoothing
- GPS coordinate transformation to meters
- 90° + 7° counter-clockwise rotation for optimal viewing
- Lap validation (15-45 second range, RPM thresholds)

### Image Specifications
- Resolution: 300 DPI (high quality)
- Format: PNG
- Dimensions: 800x500 pixels (scaled to 2667x1667 at 300 DPI)

## Data Quality Notes

- Lap 1 excluded (practice lap)
- Laps 6-7 excluded where applicable (cool-down laps)
- Only valid racing laps included (realistic times, proper RPM values)
- Beacon markers used for precise lap segmentation
