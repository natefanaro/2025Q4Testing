# RPM Overlay Comparisons

Direct visual comparisons of each test day configuration against the best qualifying lap (Race 23 Q2 Lap 5 - 19.525s).

## Files

- `config_1_vs_qualifying_overlay.png` - Config 1 vs Qualifying (0.227s faster)
- `config_2_vs_qualifying_overlay.png` - Config 2 vs Qualifying (0.122s faster)
- `config_3_vs_qualifying_overlay.png` - Config 3 vs Qualifying (0.289s faster)
- `config_4_vs_qualifying_overlay.png` - Config 4 vs Qualifying (0.424s faster) **BEST IMPROVEMENT**
- `config_5_vs_qualifying_overlay.png` - Config 5 vs Qualifying (0.245s faster)
- `config_6_vs_qualifying_overlay.png` - Config 6 vs Qualifying (0.148s slower)

## What These Show

Each overlay displays:
- **Two racing lines overlaid** on the same track
  - Red gradient = Qualifying lap (baseline)
  - Blue gradient = Configuration lap
- **RPM gradients** for both laps:
  - Darker shades = Lower RPM
  - Brighter shades = Higher RPM
- **Comparison stats** (bottom left):
  - Qualifying time: 19.525s
  - Configuration time
  - Time difference (faster/slower)
- **RPM gradient legend** (bottom right)

## Purpose

These overlays help answer:
- Did the configuration take a different racing line?
- Where are the line differences most significant?
- How do RPM patterns compare at the same track locations?
- Which configuration maintained better momentum?

## Color Gradients

**Red (Qualifying)**:
- Dark maroon → Bright red → Orange-red
- Shows RPM variation during qualifying lap

**Blue (Configuration)**:
- Dark navy → Medium blue → Bright cyan
- Shows RPM variation during test day lap

## Key Insights

- **Config 4** showed the best improvement: 0.424s faster than qualifying
- All configs except Config 6 beat the qualifying baseline
- Line differences visible where red/blue tracks don't overlap perfectly
